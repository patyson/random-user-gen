This is a small React component that generates a random user profile. It is not a complete project, just a small snippet to demonstrate React basics.

The API data is pulled from https://randomuser.me/

It includes two Sass files and two components.

React methods demonstrated: hooks, state management, useEffect, passing props between parent and child components, REST API with Fetch.

This completed component is one small part of a larger project still in progress.

Please reach out to me at philip.tyson.dev for questions or more info.

Thank you.
